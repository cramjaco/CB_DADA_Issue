This directory is for initial amplicon processing of the Chesapeake Bay Mainstem cruise from 2019. My goal is to write here which scritps I use in which order. I'd like to strive toward a reproducable pipeline.

Ah. I did this in the `AmpliconMysteryRun` project

SlayChimeras.R # I'm concerned that there are too many chimeras 66% of all sequences.
I will make a reproducable example on just the GD samples and try to get help from
DADA2 developers. In the mean time, I"ve checked that I've trimmed the primers, so I'm 
going to proceed.
